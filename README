Contracts for Java is a contract programming framework for Java, which
uses annotation processing and bytecode instrumentation to provide
run-time checking.


1. DEPENDENCIES

Contracts fo Java requires Java version 6 for annotation processing
and bytecode instrumentation. The bytecode rewriter depends on the ASM
bytecode manipulation library, version 5.x or higher. The build script
is written for Ant 1.9.1 and above.

Since the Java agent rewrites bytecode in order to inject contracts
into the loaded code, the ASM library needs to be available in the
class path at run time if contract checking is enforced through the
agent. Pre-contracted class files do not need the ASM library or the
agent to run with contracts enabled.


2. CONFIGURATION

In order for the build script to run properly, you must at least
specify the correct path to Cofoja's dependencies in your local build
properties file:

  ./local.properties

This file does not exist by default; you can either create it or start
from a copy of the default configuration file:

  ./default.properties

That file also contains all user-settable properties with their
descriptions and default values. Once you're done, set the following
property to true to let Ant run:

  configured=true


3. QUICK START

To build a JAR file containing all Cofoja classes, run:

  ant dist

The JAR file will be located at:

  ./dist/lib/cofoja-<version>.jar

It can be used both as a Java agent and annotation processor and
should be added to your class path.

To compile code with contract annotations, run:

  javac -processor com.google.java.contract.core.apt.AnnotationProcessor <someclass>.java

To execute code compiled with contract checking enabled, make sure the
generated files (additional .class and .contracts files) are in your
class path, and run:

  java -javaagent:path/to/cofoja-<version>.jar <someclass>


4. ADVANCED BUILD

Contracts for Java is annotated with its own contracts, which can be
compiled, tested and bundled into the result JAR file so it checks its
own contracts when compiling and checking your program's contracts!

Please note that running such a build will necessarily be slower than
running an unchecked version of Contracts for Java, but is a great way
for you to contribute to the project by helping exercise its own
capabilities while using it.

To build a contracted version of Contracts for Java, you need to have
a Cofoja JAR file ready first (see previous section; or you could
reuse one you've built with a previous run of this bootstrap
process). Copy the JAR file to:

  ./build/bootstrap.jar

Then run:

  ant bootstrap

Once the contracted version is complete, you can run the test suite
with:

  ant test

Aside from self-contracted builds, Cofoja JAR files bundled with ASM
library classes can also be produced, for the sake of easier
distribution:

  ant -Dasmjar=path/to/asm-all-<version>.jar dist


5. USAGE

Contracts for Java consists of an annotation processor, an
instrumentation agent, as well as an offline bytecode rewriter. The
annotation processor compiles annotations into separate contract class
files. The instrumentation agent weaves these contract files with the
real classes before they are loaded into the JVM. Alternatively, the
offline bytecode rewriter can be used to produce pre-weaved class
files that can be directly deployed without any Cofoja dependency.

The following instructions assume that you have the Cofoja and ASM JAR
files in your class path.

The annotation processor's entry point is (for use with the -processor
javac option):

  com.google.java.contract.core.apt.AnnotationProcessor

The Java agent can be invoked from the compiled JAR file (for use with
the -javaagent java option):

  ./dist/cofoja-<version>.jar

The offline instrumenter can be run with:

  java -Dcom.google.java.contract.classoutput=<outdir> \
    com.google.java.contract.core.agent.PreMain <someclass>.class
